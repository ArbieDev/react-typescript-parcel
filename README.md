# react-typescript-parcel
Building TypeScript React with Parcel without spending your time setting up compilers.

If you would like to code in JavaScript, 
please try my [react-parcel](https://github.com/ArbieDev/react-parcel).

### Requirement
- Node.js & npm
- parcel-bundler (global installation is recommended)

### Get Started
- `npm install` to install all dependencies as usual
- `npm start` to compile code
- OR `parcel index.html` to run compiler by yourself and try some options like `-d public`
- by default parcel would start a local server `localhost:1234`
- OR `parcel watch index.html` which doesn't start a sever
