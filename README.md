# react-typescript-parcel

Building TypeScript React with Parcel without spending your time setting up compilers.

If you would like to code in JavaScript,
please try my [react-parcel](https://github.com/ArbieDev/react-parcel).

### Requirement

- Node.js & npm (in order to call local modules, `npx` or `yarn` is needed)
- parcel-bundler (global installation is recommended, then it can be called with simply `parcel`)

### Get Started

- `npm install` to install all dependencies as usual
- `npm start` to compile code
- by default parcel would start a local server `localhost:1234` and compile to `dist` directory
- OR `npx parcel watch index.html` which doesn't start a sever
